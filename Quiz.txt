Drinks
Each of these are tasting notes for a red wine, a white wine or a beer. Guess which

1 - Deep, black fruit on the nose with herbaceous notes. It's unreal with barbecue-smoked sausage - Red Wine
2 - Inviting raspberry on a refreshing but subtle sourness - Beer
3 - Intense citrus and herbal character with a touch of ripe tropical fruit - White Wine
4 - Totally hand-made, rich and deeply delicious. It's lavishly fruited and swathed in very fine oak - Red Wine
5 - Light and zesty in appearance and flavour - Beer
