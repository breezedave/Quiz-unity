History

Throughout history, empires have controlled large proportions of the planet. In any order, I'd like you to list the top five largest empires by land mass.

In 1920, with control of 26.35% of the world, the British Empire was the largest empire of all time.

In 1270, with 17.81% under its power, the Mongol Empire was the second largest.

In 1895, with 16.92% under its rule, the Russian Empire was the third largest.

In 1790, the Qing [Ching] dynasty ruled 10.91% of the planet.

And finally, in 1810, the Spanish Empire ran 10.17% of the world.
